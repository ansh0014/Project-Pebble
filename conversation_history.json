    "ai_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out who the Prime Minister of India is. I'm not too sure, but I think it's someone named Narendra Modi. I've heard his name come up a lot in the news, especially related to Indian politics and recent events. I remember that he's been in office for a while now, maybe two terms? I'm trying to recall when he first became Prime Minister\u2014was it around 2014? That seems right because I remember some significant elections around that time. \n\nWait, let me double-check in my mind. Before Modi, there was Manmohan Singh, right? He was the Prime Minister for a couple of terms, I think from 2004 to 2014. So after him, it must have been Modi who took over. I've also heard about some of his policies, like demonetization and the push for digital India, which made headlines a few years back. \n\nBut I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact years. I think Modi's first term started in 2014, and then he was re-elected in 2019. So that would mean he's been serving as Prime Minister since May 2014. His party is the BJP, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is one of the major political parties in India. They've been quite influential, especially under Modi's leadership. \n\nI should also consider if there have been any changes recently. Sometimes, in some countries, there are unexpected shifts in leadership, but I don't recall hearing anything about Modi stepping down or losing an election. So, it's safe to assume he's still the Prime Minister as of now. \n\nAnother point to think about is his background. If I remember correctly, Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat before becoming the Prime Minister. That experience might have contributed to his national prominence, which helped him win the Prime Minister position. \n\nI think his tenure has been marked by several initiatives, some controversial, but he has a strong base of support. So, putting it all together, I'm pretty confident that Narendra Modi is the current Prime Minister of India, having served since 2014 with his second term starting in 2019. I don't think I've missed any major changes or updates, so this should be correct.\n</think>\n\nNarendra Modi is the Prime Minister of India, serving since May 2014. He was re-elected in 2019, leading the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)."
